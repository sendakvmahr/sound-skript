Refactoring

Make key and "starting note" seperate - and see if you can make the starting note relative to last melody
	but since this is intended to be a melody mainly generator, default to note3 if unspecified - can be edited later 

Presets 

Right now, eight and sixteenth notes are rather messily coupled - 

Fix possible generation of out-of-midi-range notes (note < 21 or note > 108)

repeat melody chance - it only affects melody, not note repetition

Readme and think of a nice name

UI - this is a giant pile of arguments 

Choose instrument it plays in 

multiple notes playing at a time
